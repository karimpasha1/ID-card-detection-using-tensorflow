# ID-card-detection-using-tensorflow
This project uses TensorFlow and deep learning techniques to detect and localize ID cards in images. It leverages a pre-trained object detection model, fine-tuned on a custom dataset of ID cards. The system can be used for automating document verification workflows in applications like onboarding and KYC.
